# Coffee Shop Full Stack app

## Description

Coffee shop is a drink menu web application for a digital cafe and has the user experience features below:

1. Displays graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2. Allows public users to view drink names and graphics.
3. Allows the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4. Allows the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

As a developer, completing this app enables me to showcase my ability to implement a well structured API that performs authentication and authorization of users accessing the various resources.

This project is completed as a requirement for my Udacity full-stack web developer nanodegree, specifically for the class 'Identification and Access Management'.

## Technologies

Flask <br>
Angular <br>
Postman <br>
SQLAlchemy <br>
Auth0

## About the Stack

The full stack application is designed with standalone backend and frontend applications.

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a completed Flask server, an SQLAlchemy module to simplify your data needs, and a unit test file.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete Ionic frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. You will only need to update the environment variables found within (./frontend/src/environment/environment.ts) to reflect the Auth0 configuration details set up for the backend app.

[View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)
